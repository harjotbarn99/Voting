voting app for Get Seeded

#### This is not the original getseeded app (the original is private), I made this app in the starting of my summer vacation after my freshman year but later i learned Django during that summer and made a new app bith better backen and frontend


Admin - 
  add participants or delete them
  create random strings used for voting and delete them
  enable or disable voting
  get the results
  
Users- 
   use the random code provided and cast vote ( if voting is enabled)
   
  

the random string used for voting get deleted after vote is casted but if the voting is disabled then the vote is not casted and the random string is not deleted.
